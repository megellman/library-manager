## Description 

SQL Library Manager is a command-line application built with Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. It allows librarians to manage books, members, and borrowing records directly from the terminal. Users can view and update the libraryâ€™s inventory, manage members, record borrowings and returns, and view reports.

This project was built to practice designing relational database schemas, using SQL joins, and implementing interactive CLI applications with Node.js. It provides a practical foundation for handling persistent data outside of web applications.

<br />

## Usage 

Use the interactive menu to:

- View all books, members, and borrow records.
- Add books and members.
- Record borrowings with auto-generated due dates.
- Record book returns.


## Bonus

Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

* View overdue books.  
* View currently borrowed books by member.  
* Delete members or books.  
* Update member contact info.  
* Generate a report of most borrowed books.
